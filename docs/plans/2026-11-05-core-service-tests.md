# Tests for the core services

**Goal:** each core service gets unit tests for its business rules, written and merged once that service's code is complete on `main`, and CI runs them on every PR.

**Core services:** api-gateway, user-service, airline-core-service, flight-ops-service, seat-service, booking-service, payment-service, notification-service.
**Scope:** `src/test/` of those services, test dependencies in their `pom.xml`, the test step in `.github/workflows/backend.yml`, `.claude/rules/testing.md`.
**Out of scope:** tests for location, pricing and ancillary (small catalog services: CI compiles them, nothing more; see ADR-013). Frontend tests. Plain getters, mappers without logic, CRUD that only calls a repository.
**Contract changes:** none. Tests only; a bug a test finds gets its own `fix(...)` commit.

## Kinds of test

| Kind | Tools | For |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ (same style as `UserServiceImplTest`) | Rules in one class: validation, branches, status changes, errors. No Spring, no database, no Docker |
| Slice | `@WebFluxTest` style on the gateway, like `SecurityConfigTest` | Routes and security rules |
| Context | `IntegrationTest` + Testcontainers | The service starts: Flyway migrations run, Hibernate validates the schema |
| Concurrency | `IntegrationTest` + `Concurrently` (already written) | Races and duplicates, see `.claude/rules/testing.md` |

A unit test covers the branches a concurrency test doesn't reach. It doesn't repeat a race: mocks can't prove a lock works.

## Tasks, in push order

A service's tests go up once its code is complete on `main`, in a `test/<service>` PR or in the PR that completes it. Exact cases are chosen from the code when the tests are written.

- [x] 1. **api-gateway**: `UserContextGatewayFilter` (trusted headers set, client-sent `X-User-*` stripped), `LocalUserResolver`.
- [x] 2. **user-service**: extend `UserServiceImplTest`; `InternalApiKeyVerifier`.
- [x] 3. **airline-core-service**: `AirlineServiceImpl`, `AircraftServiceImpl`; context test on Testcontainers.
- [x] 4. **flight-ops-service**: `FlightSearchServiceImpl`, `FlightInstanceServiceImpl`, `FlightScheduleServiceImpl`, `FlightServiceImpl`; context test on Testcontainers.
- [ ] 5. **seat-service** (after build step 6): `SeatInstanceServiceImpl`, `SeatMapServiceImpl`, `SeatServiceImpl`; with the seat concurrency tests.
- [ ] 6. **booking-service** (after build step 6): `BookingServiceImpl`, `BookingCompensator`, `PaymentEventListener`, `BookingExpiryJob`; with the saga concurrency tests.
- [ ] 7. **payment-service** (after build step 6): `VnPayService` (signature, amount, RspCode mapping), `PaymentServiceImpl`; with the IPN concurrency tests.
- [ ] 8. **notification-service** (after build step 8): `BookingNotificationListener` (dedupe, event to email).

Each task also adds the service to the test step in `backend.yml` if it isn't there yet.

## Verification

- Unit tests: `mvn -B -ntp test -pl <service> -am` passes on a clean copy of `main` plus the new tests, then green on the PR.
- Tests that use Testcontainers need Docker: run them locally when Docker is on; CI is the check otherwise, and that is stated in the PR.
- At least one test per class is broken on purpose once (change the rule, watch it fail) so a test can't pass by accident.

## Result

Plan written 2026-11-05. Tasks 1 and 2 done the same day: 21 new tests, run on a clean copy of `main`; one rule per class broken on purpose and caught by its test.

Tasks 3 and 4 done 2026-11-06: 59 new unit tests, run on a clean copy of `main`; one rule per class broken on purpose and caught. The two context tests move to Testcontainers; Docker was off, so CI is their first run.
